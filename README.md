# Isobar Technical Test Notes

Iâ€™ve focused on the functional aspects of the test to demonstrate my React and Redux knowledge and how I approach technical problems and design solutions.

First I identified and created the courses data structure in the courses Reducer and then built out the relevant components to display this as apart of the overall course search. Then I moved onto the filtering. What I have built is very visually basic but tried to demonstrate my SASS knowledge as best possible. I timeboxed my implementation to 4 hours. However, if I spent more time on the test I would implement the remaining 1-10 steps and also action the following:

* Implement unit tests for React components using Jest and Enzyme
* Add additional ascending and descending modifiers to the duration and publish date * sort filters
* Implement more detailed styling
